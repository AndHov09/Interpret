Simple Interpreter

The Simple Interpreter is a basic interpreter that allows you to execute programs written in a custom programming language. It provides parsing, lexical analysis, and execution capabilities to interpret and execute code written in the target language.
Features

    Parsing: The interpreter includes a parsing component that analyzes the input code and breaks it down into meaningful tokens, following the rules and grammar of the target language. This ensures that the code is correctly structured and ready for interpretation.

    Lexical Analysis: The interpreter incorporates a lexical analysis phase that scans the input code, identifying and categorizing tokens such as keywords, variables, operators, and literals. This process allows for the recognition of individual elements in the code and prepares them for interpretation.

    Execution: The interpreter executes the parsed and analyzed code, interpreting each statement and carrying out the corresponding actions. It supports basic control flow structures like loops and conditionals, as well as variable assignment, arithmetic operations, and function calls. The interpreter faithfully translates the code into executable actions, producing the desired output or behavior.

    Error Handling: The interpreter includes robust error handling mechanisms to detect and report syntax errors, semantic errors, or runtime errors in the code. It provides informative error messages to aid in debugging and improving the code quality.

    Extensibility: The project offers a foundation for further language development or expansion. By understanding the structure and components of the interpreter, developers can extend the language's capabilities by adding new features, syntax rules, or built-in functions.
    
Usage
To use the Simple Interpreter, follow these steps:

    1.Clone the project repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/AndHov09/Interpret.git.

    2.Open the project in your preferred development environment or compile the source files using your C++ compiler.

    3.Write or load a program written in the custom programming language supported by the interpreter.

    4.Execute the interpreter, providing the path to your program as an argument: interpreter myprogram.txt.

    5.The interpreter will parse, analyze, and execute the code, producing the desired output or behavior as defined in the program.
